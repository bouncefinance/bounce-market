The arbitration shall be administered by </span><span class="c1 c4">JAMS </span><span class="c2 c1">pursuant to streamlined arbitration rules and procedures, and the arbitrator shall apply the laws applicable in the state of California. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction as specified above under &ldquo;governing law and venue.&rdquo; This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief or provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You agree that all disputes must be brought in Your individual capacity and not as a Plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. By entering into this agreement and agreeing to arbitration, You agree that it is waiving the right to file a lawsuit and the right to a trial by jury. In addition, You agree to waive the right to participate in a class action or litigation on a class-wide basis. You agree that it has expressly and knowingly waived these rights.
